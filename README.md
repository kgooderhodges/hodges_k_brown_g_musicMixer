# The Aesthetic Interpretor

## Take the aesthetic icons that speak to you and drop them in the interpretor.
## Then kick back and listen to the sounds of your Aesthetic come to life in layers of Lofi Vaporwave Chill-hop.

### Or keep mixing things around until you find the track that speaks to you the most
